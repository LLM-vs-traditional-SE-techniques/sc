Above are a few test generation examples from the current version of AIDE as you can see AIDE produces at times very specific tests for API methods, but a few of the other tests demonstrate more just coverage. For example the ```testAdd_whenAddingEdgeRootMustBeSet``` in the second test example tests a pre-condition that is clear to a developer. Specifically that an Edge can not be add to a path until the root was set.
